| 6 | To accept a student's marks for five subjects, compute his/her result. Student is passing if he/she scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course. If student scores aggregate greater than 75%, then the grade is distinguished. If aggregate is 60>= and <75 then theGrade of first division. If aggregate is 50>= and <60, then the grade is second division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is third division. | [Q06.c](Q06.c) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J0YnDtz8ks&list=PLlShVH4JA0ouBb_iMZPPNOcfyX2JtPQ5L&index=7&pp=iAQB |

|  | Mini Project |  |  |
| 1 | Calculator with basic functions. Add more functionality such as graphic user interface and Complex calculations. | [MiniProject1.c](MiniProject1.c) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgQBWUpGpdI&list=PLlShVH4JA0ouBb_iMZPPNOcfyX2JtPQ5L&index=12&pp=iAQB |
| 2 | Program that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6 (Or other integer you prefer). Print that number. Request user to roll again. Set the min and max number that dice can show. For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. | [MiniProject2.c](MiniProject2.c) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtw21Eat1o&list=PLlShVH4JA0ouBb_iMZPPNOcfyX2JtPQ5L&index=13&pp=iAQB |
| 3 | Guess Number: Randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. the number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. Write functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers. | [MiniProject3.c](MiniProject3.c) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MF9F_pnDsg&list=PLlShVH4JA0ouBb_iMZPPNOcfyX2JtPQ5L&index=14&pp=iAQB |
| 4 | To calculate the salary of an employee given his basic pay (take as input from user). Calculate gross salary of employee. Let HRA be 10 % of basic pay and TA be 5% of basic pay. Let employees pay professional tax as 2% of total salary. Calculate net salary payable after deductions. | [MiniProject4.c](MiniProject4.c) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYoJPH3mMzc&list=PLlShVH4JA0ouBb_iMZPPNOcfyX2JtPQ5L&index=15&pp=iAQB |
